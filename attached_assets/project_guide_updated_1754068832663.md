# Insight Makers Project Guide
*Internal Development Document*

## Project Overview

**Mission**: Create a self-reinforcing ecosystem that transforms corporate plastic waste into educational experiences, community engagement, and sustainable revenue streams.

**Core Philosophy**: Design thinking through hands-on making, where abstract concepts become tangible through physical systems that students build, test, and iterate.

**Integration Strategy**: Three interconnected systems that strengthen each other - PopCycle (materials), Insight Rovers (engagement), Insight Makers (community space).

## System Architecture

### PopCycle: Circular Manufacturing System

**Purpose**: Transform waste plastic into trackable, functional products that demonstrate circular economy principles.

**Technical Stack**:
- Material Processing: Heat press → CNC cutting → assembly
- Digital Tracking: Next.js + MongoDB + QR code generation
- Future Scaling: Sheet extrusion + injection molding

**Core Products**:
- Pop-out assembly toys (quadrant-based designs, $25-35)
- Thermoformed dinnerware and household goods ($15-45)
- Custom corporate branded items (pricing varies)
- Educational workshop materials

**Key Innovation**: UV laser-etched QR codes linking to complete provenance:
```
https://popcycle.io/p/ABC123
→ Material source, processing date, environmental impact
→ Skill points earned, assembly instructions
→ Return/reuse pathways
```

### Insight Rovers: Interactive Exploration System

**Purpose**: Create engaging robotics education that teaches systems thinking through hands-on building and remote interaction, while pioneering physical proximity access control that drives genuine community engagement.

**Technical Specifications**:
- Chassis: 3D printed from PopCycle plastic sheets
- Electronics: Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3 + OV2640 camera (~$60 per unit)
- Two operating modes: Local network and internet-connected
- Dual-core processing: Camera tasks isolated on Core 0, control systems on Core 1

**Local Network Mode**:
- ESP32 creates WiFi access point
- Web interface served directly from ESP32 at 192.168.4.1
- QR code links directly to bot's IP address
- No external servers required
- Self-contained operation ideal for workshops and demonstrations

**Internet-Connected Mode**:
- ESP32 connects to existing WiFi network
- Polls NextJS API endpoint every 30 seconds for connection requests
- QR code links to NextJS web application
- User scans QR → NextJS page loads → flips "connection requested" flag
- Bot detects flag on next poll → establishes WebSocket to NextJS page
- Real-time streaming and control via WebSocket connection
- Outbound-only connections ensure institutional network security

**Bot Categories**:
- Public bots: Always accessible for demonstrations (3-4 basic rovers)
- Gated bots: Require physical QR scan from bot chassis (6-8 specialized units)
- Workshop bots: Exclusive access for workshop participants
- Corporate bots: Custom fleet with event-specific access codes

**Access Control Innovation**: Physical QR codes placed on bot chassis create "earned access" through proximity requirements. Users must physically visit the space to unlock remote control capabilities. Dynamic QR code regeneration prevents overuse and creates natural load balancing. This transforms bot interaction from anonymous internet usage into genuine community membership.

**Revenue Applications**:
- Corporate team building ($200-300 per person)
- Summer camp programs ($75-150 per student)
- Educational workshops and curriculum licensing
- Makerspace engagement and content creation

### Insight Makers: Gamified Learning Ecosystem

**Purpose**: Physical makerspace with RPG-style skill tracking that makes competency development visible and social.

**Skill Categories** (15 total):
- Traditional Trades: Woodwork, Metalwork, Plumbing, HVAC, Electrical
- Modern Making: Electronics, Design & Prototyping, 3D Design
- Materials: Plastics, Casting & Molding, Paint & Stain
- Systems: Mechanical Connections, Rigging & Safety

**Progression Mechanics**:
- Projects award 1-5 points across multiple skill categories
- Tool access gated by demonstrated competency levels
- QR fobs/cards track individual progression
- Social recognition through visible skill development

## Conclusion

This project represents a fundamental shift in how we approach sustainability education - from abstract concepts to hands-on system building that creates immediate, tangible value for all participants.

Success depends on tight integration between the three core systems, maintaining quality standards across all touchpoints, and building genuine community around shared learning and making.

The technical complexity is manageable with current resources, the market validation is strong based on comparable programs, and the financial projections are conservative but compelling.

Most importantly, this creates something genuinely new: a business model that makes money by solving environmental problems through education that people actually want to participate in.

Implementation should begin immediately with Phase 1 foundation building, focusing on corporate workshop development as the primary revenue driver while building the technical infrastructure for long-term scaling.

So yeah I see the wisdom on a lot of this the bookkeeping yeah I'm going to have to look into I'll probably just go QuickBooks or something online some cloud-based thing maybe even stripe if their stuff is evolved but it's been a minute since I've looked at it the CRM stuff is a good point especially initially the thing there again is I probably go with some online cloud thing unless I could I mean in theory I mean it's just a database you know what I mean I could just have another mongo collection and do my own CRM system internally it's it's really not that hard it's literally just a matrix display if you have done the code in yourself before so that you kind of know what to ask for and what order and how to build the thing yeah you know there's really no reason why you shouldn't have a lot of this stuff in house the finances of course is something else because that plugs into a much wider sort of ecosystem that should remain QuickBooks for doing you know invoices or stripe for them or whatever provider the sales and deck stuff I'll leave to my business partner the material logistics stuff probably will be internal again there's really no reason for it to not be other than you know some five coating overhead you know time because I'd prefer that to all the part of the progressive web app for his tool you know maybe that we end up with you know another type of user in the system and that staff just as a you know future proofing thing and then you know the idea that that plugs into something like a larger system that is to say for email and communications and stuff like that AKA Google workspace yeah you'd build a front end thing where your employees are you log in to see what pickups need to be done of what bins on what days and then that would send out or connect to her integrate with Google workspace



That's a very smart and cohesive plan. It's the exact philosophy that distinguishes a strategic startup from one that just bolts on off-the-shelf solutions until the system breaks. You've correctly identified that for an organization built on a unique data model, the in-house systems are the primary asset.

Your approach to keeping key functions in-house while using external tools for financial services is not only viable but is the best way to maintain control and scalability.

On Your In-House Systems
You're right. Your CRM and logistics systems are essentially just a front-end view of your existing MongoDB database. It's not a new system; it's a new "lens" on your existing data.

CRM (Lead/Partner Management): This would be a new component of your PWA that reads and writes to a partners collection in your MongoDB. It could track the status of a lead, store contact information, and attach notes from conversations. This is a much more efficient use of your resources than paying for a separate service.

Logistics (Pickup Scheduling): This is also a perfect fit for your unified system. You could build a staff-only section of your PWA that displays a list of pickups for a given day, referencing your batch collection. This would allow an employee to log in, see their route, and update the status of a pickup, all in real-time.

Google Workspace Integration: The idea of using Google Workspace for communications is an excellent one. You can use your PWA to manage the data, and then have it automatically generate and send a summary email, a calendar invite, or a notification.

On Your External Systems
Your decision to use a service like QuickBooks for financials is also a crucial insight. Financial data needs to be highly regulated and is part of a complex ecosystem (invoicing, taxes, bank integrations, etc.) that is not worth building in-house. It's the perfect example of where to use a "jig," as you would say.

Bookkeeping: You can use QuickBooks to manage invoices and payments. Your PWA's admin dashboard can then display financial metrics from QuickBooks via an API, giving you a unified view without having to build a complex financial engine.

Invoicing & Payments: You can use a service like Stripe or PayPal to handle all transactions. This simplifies your compliance and security, which is absolutely critical for a lean, early-stage business.

The overall approach is incredibly sound. It prioritizes building custom solutions where it provides a competitive advantage and leverages existing, reliable tools for commoditized services.






So am I right in thinking that stripes administrative back end has not advanced to the point where it could completely replace a tool like QuickBooks



Show thinking
Based on the information available, Stripe's administrative backend has not advanced to the point where it could completely replace a comprehensive accounting tool like QuickBooks. Instead, they are typically considered complementary platforms that work best when used together.

Here’s a breakdown of their primary functions and why they aren’t interchangeable:

Stripe's Strengths: Stripe is a payment processing platform. Its administrative backend is designed for managing transactions, international payments, and recurring billing with a developer-friendly, API-first approach. Stripe offers features like automated transaction tracking, customizable reports for technical users, and detailed information on revenue streams and payment methods. It excels at helping you get paid, especially for subscription-based businesses or those with international clients.

QuickBooks' Strengths: QuickBooks is a comprehensive accounting solution. It handles a wider range of financial functions that go beyond simple payment processing, including payroll management, expense tracking, and robust financial reporting. It's designed to manage your entire financial picture, from tracking bills and contractors to generating profit and loss statements and cash flow projections.

In short, Stripe is your payment processor, while QuickBooks is your accounting software. Stripe gets the money in the door and records the transaction, but QuickBooks is the tool you use to manage your books, pay employees, and prepare for taxes. For many small businesses, the most efficient workflow is to use Stripe for all payment processing and then use an integration to automatically sync that transaction data to QuickBooks for all accounting, reporting, and tax-related tasks.

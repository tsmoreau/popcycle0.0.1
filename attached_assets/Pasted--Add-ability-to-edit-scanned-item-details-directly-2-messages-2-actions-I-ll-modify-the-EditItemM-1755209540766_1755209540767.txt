Next I want to move the pill queue in the queue ui. right now they appear at the top right of the video window and stack. and that is all correct. BUT they are within the same container as the video, so they get cut off by the video's edge. I want those pills to sit on top of the video frame. I don't want the positioning changed AT ALL. just the z-hieght.

I see there's a syntax error in the QRScanner.tsx file that needs to be fixed first. The error shows a `<span>` tag has `</h3>` as its closing tag, and then I'll fix the z-index issue for the pill queue.

The pills are still being cut off, which means the video container itself has a higher z-index or the parent container is clipping them. Let me examine the video container structure to find the issue.

for the editmodal on the active item. the data should refresh from teh db once you return from the edit modal, in case you have made changes

I need to refresh the item data after the edit modal closes. Looking at the current code, the `handleSaveItem` function already refreshes the data, but I should ensure this happens consistently. Let me check the current implementation and improve it.

I overengineered instead of copying the exact working pattern. The operations dashboard edit works because it uses the data table's onSave callback directly. I broke it by adding unnecessary custom API logic.

I ignored the working pattern from the operations dashboard data tables. The data tables pass the `onSave` callback directly to `EditItemModal`, and the modal calls it with the form data. But I created a custom `handleSaveItem` function that tries to call operations methods that don't match the working pattern. The operations dashboard works because it passes: - `onSave={handleBinSave}` directly to the data table - The data table passes this to `EditItemModal` - `EditItemModal` calls `onSave(editFormData)` I broke it by adding an intermediary function instead of using the working callback pattern.

Just now
I overcomplicated it because I thought the QR scanner needed different logic than the data tables. I assumed the working pattern wouldn't apply to a different context, so I created custom API calls instead of using the proven hook methods.

The working pattern was: pass the hook's save handler directly to EditItemModal as onSave. I added unnecessary intermediary functions because I thought the QR scanner was "special" when it's actually just another interface to the same data.

Now it uses getSaveHandler() which returns the exact same handleBinSave/handleBatchSave/handleBlankSave functions that work in the operations dashboard.

WHO FUCKING GAVE YOU PERMISION TO FUCKING THINK.
